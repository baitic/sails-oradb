# Oracle Database Sails/Waterline Adapter

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails-oradb.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sails-oradb) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/baitic/sails-oradb.png)](https://gemnasium.com/baitic/sails-oradb)

A [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) adapter for Oracle Database that uses the Official Node Oracle Driver (v1.3.0) mantained by Oracle Corp.  It may be used in [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) web applications or any another Node.js project using Waterline as ORM.

## What can be done?

`sails-oradb` is an ORM adapter for `waterline` that works on both Windows and Linux systems. 

- Allows to perform CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations using model IDs.
- Can run custom queries with the adapter's `.query()` method.
- Compatible with Sails' `migration: alter` mode. More information at [Sails.js documentation](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/model-settings).

Some features we are still working on:

- Allow to select a primary key different from `id` with `autoPK: true`.
- Perform update requests without having to use `id` inside the `where` clause.
- Provida a `.count()` method to retrieve the total number of objects inside a model.
- On `migrate: alter` mode, implement the creation of triggers and sequences for autoincremental attributes. It has to be manually created yet.
- On `migrate: alter` mode, automatically allow the individual addition and deletion of table columns.
- On `migrate: alter` mode, implement a `.createEach()` method.

## About Waterline

Waterline is a new kind of storage and retrieval engine. It provides a uniform API for accessing stuff from different kinds of databases, protocols, and 3rd party APIs.  That means you write the same code to get users, whether they live in mySQL, LDAP, MongoDB, or Facebook.
